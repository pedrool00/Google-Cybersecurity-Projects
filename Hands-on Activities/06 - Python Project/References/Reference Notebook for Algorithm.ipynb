A line of code containing the `.join()` method has been added to the code so that the file can be updated. This is necessary because `ip_addresses` must be in string format when used inside the `with` statement to rewrite the file.\n\nThe `.join()` method takes in an iterable (such as a list) and concatenates every element of it into a string. The `.join()` method is applied to a string consisting of the character that will be used to separate every element in the iterable once its converted into a string. In the code below, the method is applied to the string `\" \"`, which contains just a space character. The argument of the `.join()` method is the iterable you want to convert, and in this case, that's `ip_addresses`. As a result, it converts `ip_addresses` from a list back into a string with a space between each element and the next.\n\nAfter this line with the `.join()` method, build the `with` statement that rewrites the original file. Use the `\"w\"` parameter when calling the `open()` function to delete the contents in the original file and replace it with what you want to write.",
